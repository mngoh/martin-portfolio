      <h1>How I Completed My Undergraduate Degree in 2.5 Years</h1>
      <p> Coming into college in 2018, I already had a good idea that I wanted to graduate early. Fortunately, I already had 30 credits coming from high school through AP and Dual Enrollment courses.
      </p>
           <h2>Graduation Timeline</h2>
      <h3>Freshman Year - 2018</h3>
      <p> I started at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in August of 2018. I started out with the goal of pursuing an undergraduate degree in Finance but then changed to Supply Chain management and
         Analytics. I was also on the men's soccer team while at VCU.
      </p>

      <p> In the winter of 2018-2019 I completed a course that gave me 3 credits. </p>

      <h3>Sophomore Year - 2019 </h3>
      <p>As a sophomore, I had gotten into the routine of both school and soccer. I started off strong in the fall achieving a 4.0 GPA. 
      </p>

      <p> It was going very well until Spring of 2020. That changed a lot of things... During the Spring semester I took 18 credits and in the summer I took 9 credits including an internship.</p>
      
      <h3>Junior/Senior Year - 2020</h3>
      <p>My final fall at VCU consisted of practicing with the men's soccer team and taking my final courses in Supply Chain Management and Analytics. 
      </p>

      <p> It was a bitter sweet end to my time at VCU because most things were closed on campus due to COVID.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p> Overall, graduating with my Bachelor's Degree in Business with a Concentration in Supply Chain Management and Analytics, was a major milestone on in my career and I'm grateful for the 
        opportunity.
      </p>

      <p> Hopefully you can find inspiration in my journey to pursue your goals, no matter what they are. The journey is never easy but the ultimate goal is very fulfilling.
